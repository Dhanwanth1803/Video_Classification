# Violence Detection Project

The Violence Detection Project is a venture aimed at distinguishing between violent and non-violent activities. Initially, it began by leveraging a substantial dataset containing instances of both violent and non-violent activities. However, due to computational constraints, the dataset had to be downsized, resulting in a compromise on the accuracy of the model. Nevertheless, the project served as an invaluable learning experience. Looking ahead, the project aspires to evolve into a real-time interface, harboring the potential to bolster safety measures, particularly during nocturnal hours. Employing Python and machine learning, along with requisite data processing libraries, the project seeks to democratize safety mechanisms by employing advanced algorithms to discern between various activities. Future iterations aim to enhance accuracy by optimizing algorithms and leveraging larger datasets, culminating in the development of a real-time interface for live violence detection.
